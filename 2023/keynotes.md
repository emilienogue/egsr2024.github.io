#### Andrew Whitehurst, Industrial Light and Magic <br> The Magic of The Man in the Hat: Creating VFX for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

Andrew Whitehurst served as production Visual Effects Supervisor on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The film features around 2350 visual effects shots, created over three years, using a wide range of technologies from traditional to state of the art. In this talk he will breakdown a handful of shots to explain the creative process from initial idea to completion, why certain techniques were selected for these shots, and why to succeed requires the use of the simplest of technologies, a pencil, as well as the most complex. 

*Andrew Whitehurst is a senior visual effects supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic with 25 years of experience. He has worked on films as diverse as Ex Machina, for which he won an Academy Award, Paddington, and Skyfall. His most recent project was Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.*
