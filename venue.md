### Accommodation Options

For your convenience, we recommend the following accommodation options:

- **Summer Accommodation:**  We have reserved a limited set of single and double occupancy rooms in the Prince's Gardens student accommodations of Imperial (https://www.celestavenues.co.uk/accommodation/central-london/princes-gardens/) which are available in the summer. The rooms at Prince's Gardens are significantly cheaper than hotels nearby in the South Kensington area around Imperial College and will be available to book by attendees on a first come first serve basis. Booking option coming soon.

- **Hotels:** There are several hotels located near Imperial College London in the surrounding South Kensington and Gloucester Road areas. These hotels offer comfortable stays and are within easy reach of the conference venue. Slightly cheaper options are available a bit further away in Earl's Court and High Street Kensington areas.

Make the most of your EGSR 2024 experience with comfortable and accessible accommodation options.
