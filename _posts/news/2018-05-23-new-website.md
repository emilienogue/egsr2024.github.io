Hi everyone,

It’s been time for a facelift for the trusty old CVMP website, and you’re looking at the resulting shiny new website right now.

As we’re starting from a clean slate, we’ll take this opportunity to add back content after dusting it off a bit.
This will take place over the coming weeks and months, as we’re preparing for CVMP 2018 in December at the BFI Southbank.

By the way, our new website is based on the excellent template created by Santiago Montesdeoca and Amir Semmo for the [Expressive 2018](http://expressive.graphics/2018/) symposium.

More information coming soon!
