### What is CVMP?

CVMP brings together the worlds of academic algorithmic research and post production to discuss new advancements and innovative applications. It is also a unique networking opportunity.

“CVMP offered a good mix of research people in graphics and vision as well as industry experts in production and post-production. Surprisingly for such a smaller conference, papers, speeches and posters were continuously of good quality. The time I spent in London was a good investment.” Jurgen Stauder, Technical Advisor, Thomson Corporate Research

##### New Collaborations

Bringing together great minds, all interested in visual media, produces some amazing results and some very fruitful collaborations.

Industry/Academia collaborations are really beneficial to both sides. Industry can meet the leading Researchers in Europe and get insights into specific technological advances and Researchers can see what problems really need solving in the industrial practice of Visual Media Production.

In previous years, CVMP has led to further collaborative work such as Funded Project Partnerships, offers of employment and working together to problem solve on productions.


##### Accessible

The BFI provides an accessible forum for the European Media Industry and is a great place to meet your peers and to strengthen current partnerships. We bring the high calibre speakers from around the world, to the centre of London.


##### Friendly

The drinks evening held on the first day is attended by both speakers and attendees and is an ideal opportunity to discuss topics raised in the conference and to brainstorm with like-minded people.
