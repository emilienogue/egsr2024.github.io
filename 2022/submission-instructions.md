Authors should upload a PDF file of no more than 20 MB containing their paper for review. Full papers submissions may optionally include supplementary materials in a single ZIP file of no more than 100 MB (for example, videos or PDFs of additional results).

### Instructions for authors of full papers

Full formatting instructions and LaTeX templates are available here:\\
