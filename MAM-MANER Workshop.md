    <h2>Colocated Event: <span style="color: #6495ED;">Eurographics Workshop on Material Appearance Modeling</span> (MAM2024) and <span style="color: #6495ED;">MANER Conference London 2024</span> (Material Appearance Network for Education and Research)</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this event, which will take place at Imperial College London, England, on July 2nd, 2024, in conjunction with EGSR 2024 (The 35th Eurographics Symposium on Rendering, see <a href="https://www.egsr2024.uk/">https://www.egsr2024.uk/</a>), is to discuss and define open issues in the acquisition, modeling, perception, and applications of material appearance. In this workshop, we gather researchers and potential users of material appearance models across disciplines and domains, to define what the major challenges and problems are in this area. One output of the workshop will be a document available through the EG Digital Library (past editions are at <a href="http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/2584">http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/2584</a>) that is intended to help guide future development of material appearance modeling. As in previous years, the workshop will include short presentations of position papers. Types of position papers include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acquisition systems</li>
        <li>Perceptual studies of material appearance</li>
        <li>Digital material authoring systems</li>
        <li>Fabrication of material appearance</li>
        <li>New representations of material appearance</li>
        <li>Applications requiring high fidelity appearance modeling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Special topics highlighted this year:</h2>
    <h3>SPECTRAL RESOURCES</h3>
    <p>Suitable topics of this type include description of the role of spectral data and software in material appearance models. What resources are currently available? What resources are needed? What new applications could be opened â€“ e.g. material modeling for remote sensing?</p>
    <h3>MATERIAL MODELING FOR MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING DATA</h3>
    <p>Many advances in modeling materials have been made by training networks with synthetic data. How reliable and/or useful are the systems that have been developed so far? How useful are current material appearance models in developing training data for machine learning for critical applications such as automated part inspection and autonomous driving?</p>
    <h3>APPEARANCE REFLECTIONS AND EXTENSIONS</h3>
    <p>If you recently published a journal paper (including Eurographics and SIGGRAPH papers) on material appearance and have additional data, information or insights about the work beyond what was presented in the original paper, you are welcome to present these at the workshop. Submit an abstract summarizing what you will present that augments the original paper.</p>

    <h2>SUBMISSION</h2>
    <p>All submissions should be four pages or less in length, using the Style Guide given in <a href = "{{site.url}}/files/2024/MAM-MANER2024.zip">MAM-MANER 2024 Author Guidelines</a>. The deadline for submissions is June 4th, 2024. Submissions and any questions should be sent via email to the workshop organizers: Holly Rushmeier (<a href="mailto:holly@acm.org">holly@acm.org</a>), Jon Yngve Hardeberg (<a href="mailto:jon.hardeberg@ntnu.no">jon.hardeberg@ntnu.no</a>). Do not hesitate to drop us a line beforehand about your intention to submit. More information about the event will be available at <a href="https://www.egsr2024.uk/">https://www.egsr2024.uk/</a> and <a href="https://maner.network/">https://maner.network/</a>.</p>
