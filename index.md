## 3rd July - 5th July, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London, UK

Welcome to the 35th Eurographics Symposium on Rendering (EGSR).

The 35th edition of Eurographics Symposium on Rendering event continues the series of highly successful Eurographics Symposia and Workshops on Rendering. The 35th edition of EGSR returns once again (after 23 years!) to London, and will be held from July 3rd to July 5th, 2024. The venue for EGSR 2024 is the Dept. of Computing, located in the South Kensington campus of Imperial College London (right next to multiple Museums, Royal Albert Hall, and Hyde Park), and is being jointly organized by the <a href="https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/">Realistic Graphics and Imaging group</a>
at Imperial College and the <a href="http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group</a>
 at University College London (UCL). 
 
 EGSR will be preceded by a new joint Workshop on <a href="/MAM-MANER Workshop">Material Appearance Modeling (MAM) and MANER conference</a> on July 2nd. The MAM-MANER 2024 workshop will be followed by a joint <a href="/social">MAM-MANER-EGSR drinks reception</a> in the evening on July 2nd that will be open to all attendees of both conferences. We look forward to welcoming you to London!
