## Frequently Asked Questions:
<!--<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will EGSR 2020 be held this year?</i></p>

<p>Yes! We are planning on a full EGSR 2020 program, including research and industry papers as well as keynotes.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will the submission deadline be extended because of COVID-19?</i></p>

<p>Due to the developing COVID-19 situation, we have pushed back the research papers abstract deadline to Monday April 13 and the paper submission deadline to April 17.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will there be support for remote presentation of papers?</i></p>

<p>All accepted papers must have at least one author registered for the conference to present the paper. We will provide a mechanism for remote presentation of the talk.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will it be possible to attend the conference remotely?</i></p>

<p>This yearâ€™s EGSR will take place completely virtually. We are currently evaluating available options for remote attendance and the format and details for this are still being worked out. Authors of accepted papers this year will be asked to present their work remotely. We encourage authors to submit work to EGSR despite the altered circumstances of a virtual EGSR meeting.</p>
