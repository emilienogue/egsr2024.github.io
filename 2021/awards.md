## Nominations

Nowadays, open-source software and publicly-available data sets are of high importance to research in many domains, including Computer Graphics.
For this reason, the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering decided to honor the best software and the best data set that are publicly available.
We are looking for high-quality contributions that are expected to make (or have made) a large impact on the community.
All contributions made in the last 5 years (after 31. Dec. 2015) are eligible for submission.

Any work can be nominated. You can propose others but are also invited to nominate yourself via this form: [https://forms.gle/tHrz9aBesWEBEALu5](https://forms.gle/tHrz9aBesWEBEALu5)

The winners will be honored at this year's EGSR event.

We are looking forward to hearing from you!
