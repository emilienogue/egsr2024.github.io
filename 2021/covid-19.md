### COVID-19 ###

To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, we will require each attendee to adhere to the following safety measures:

- <strong>Face masks must be worn at all times</strong> during the event, except when delivering a presentation, eating or drinking. We recommend wearing masks that offer a good level of protection: surgical, FFP2 or FFP3 masks (rather than face coverings). Physical distancing will be encouraged.

- Each attendee will take two COVID-19 lateral flow or PCR tests: within 24h before the first and then the second day of the conference. Attendees who have recovered from COVID-19 within the last 90 days don't need to take tests.

- If any delegate, or any close contact of them, tests positive for COVID-19 within 10 days before the conference, that person must not attend the event. In the case of a positive test result, the organizers will issue a full refund of the registration fee and arrange a remote presentation if necessary.
