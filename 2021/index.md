## Eurographics Symposium on Rendering -- [**Register now!**](https://tickets.kwt-uni-saarland.de/EGSR2021/)

The 32nd edition of the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering will be held from June 29th to July 2nd, 2021.
It will be a fully virtual event. Participation will be free of charge, thanks to our [generous sponsors](sponsors).
Details on the program and format will be announced shortly.

## Workshop on Material Appearance Modeling -- **Cancelled**

Due to the low number of submissions we are cancelling MAM 2021, which was to be held virtually. Meeting together in person for spontaneous discussions is the strength of the workshop, so this is not surprising as the end of online-only events is in sight. We will reassess holding the workshop next year when in-person meetings will be possible again.
