All submissions should be made via the CVMP 2021 submission site:\\

Authors should upload a PDF file of no more than 20 MB containing their paper for review. Full papers submissions may optionally include supplementary materials in a single ZIP file of no more than 100 MB (for example, videos or PDFs of additional results).

### Instructions for authors of full papers

Full formatting instructions and LaTeX templates are available here:\\
<https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors>

To set up the LaTeX template for anonymous submission, assign the “**sigconf**” style in the document class as follows:

```
\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

Additionally, please set the conference details in the template as follows:

```

Full papers should be of no more than 10 pages.

### Instructions for authors of short papers and demos
